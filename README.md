## Tell me a little about yourself

Well hi. I'm Rob Kendal, a freelance full-stack developer and UI engineer based in ~~sunny~~ Yorkshire. I build a variety of things for a variety of people using fancy tools, frameworks, platforms and libraries including:

 - React
 - JavaScript
 - Next.js
 - Astro
 - HTML/CSS
 - Node
 - Serverless stacks
 - ...and a ton of other bits and bobs
 
 You can always take a look at [my helpful articles on my website](https://robkendal.co.uk).
 
## Tell me about the freelancing

I run [K-Tech](https://robkendal.co.uk) (my trading name), a small-but-mighty freelance development team specialising in Jamstack development and web apps built with React and on top of headless content management systems, such as GraphCMS, Astro JS, and Storyblock to name a few.

I'm also a Shopify partner so I love to help clients get their business online by building custom Shopify themes, apps, and managing their ecommerce websites.
 
## What else do you do?

I try to spend as much time as I can helping the dev community by:

- Writing [helpful articles on web development](https://robkendal.co.uk/blog).
- Producing a [Beginner's Guide to React](https://www.newline.co/courses/beginners-guide-to-real-world-react), a self-study online course dedicated to helping beginners start out with React.
- Publishing books such as my FREE title, [Aspire to Hired!](https://gumroad.com/l/from-aspire-to-hired), all about starting to code and landing a dev job.
- Publishing a podcast, [The Front End](https://thefrontendpodcast.site/).

## Hmm...I still want to know more

Sure thing; you got it!

I got into computers (and video games) from an early age. Although I liked maths and science, computers were always my first love.

My first real job was in a school as a network technician, building machines for classrooms and looking after the general network infrastructure. From there, I found my way into the ambulance service, working as part of a team to manage and support the Yorkshire Ambulance Service IT infrastructure.

It was in the ambulance service where I fell into web development ‚Äì it's more common of a starting story than you might think! I learnt asp.net ‚Äì in it's original 2.0 flavour ‚Äì using Visual Basic and moving onto C#.

After building a number of internal web systems, I found myself doing less infrastructure support and more development.

That was it for me, the defining moment where I knew I wanted to develop all the things! I moved into the commercial sector, moving around a few creative agencies and working with some super-talented people, hopefully learning as much from them along the way.

More recently, I co-founded a creative marketing agency and managed HubSpot campaigns for some local business heroes as well as some bigger players, such as North Yorkshire County Council. We even won some awards for our work!

Right now, I'm very excited to be working on a range of projects involving React and Node JS. I enjoy blogging, presenting at events (and sharing as much knowledge as I can), and learning something new every day.

I also run a web development podcast called [The Front End](https://thefrontendpodcast.site/) which is available on [Anchor podcasts](https://anchor.fm/the-front-end).

## Anything else?

Erm....not really. If you like rock music, I also play guitar and have some recordings kicking around [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/rkendal).
